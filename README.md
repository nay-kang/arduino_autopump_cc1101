# autopump arduino

first use sonar to detect water level in tank,for backup,also has a wire in tank.
when wire sink in water.it will be closure.
arduino use these sensor to decide when power on the pump
and the pump and the tank is far away in distance.so need cc1101 for wireless transfer

*but I only finish the sonar*
